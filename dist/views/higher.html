            <em><h5>April 27, 2016</h5></em>
            <br>
            <p>
            At first the concept of higher order functions can be quite intimidating for a JavaScript beginner.
            Maybe you have just finished up the JavaScript track on Codecademy or have taken a few lessons on 
            Code School. While I am all for looking at those sites to get a gentle introduction to JavaScript and its syntax,
            those sites typical won’t cover some much of the advanced functions real developers use each and everyday. Today I
            will be exploring how higher order functions work and why you should be using them.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4 class="text-primary">WHAT IS A HIGHER ORDER FUNCTION</h4>
            <p>
            In the most simplest terms, a higher order function is a function that takes in another function as an argument.
            You may also see the term “callback” and both callback and higher order functions are the same thing. You can say
            that a higher order function takes in a callback as an argument to it.
            <br>
            <br>
            I will use the common forEach and reduce to solve a simple problem. I want to take an array of integers and sum all
            the numbers in the array and return the sum. Before I go straight into the two higher order functions I will first
            use the common “for loop” to solve the exact same problem. If you have any sort of experience with JavaScript you
            will be able to fully understand how the for loop works.
            <br>
            <blockquote class="well">
              <p>
              var arr = [1,5,10,25,100,50];<br>
              
              var sum = 0;<br>
              
              for (var i=0; i < arr.length; i++) {<br>
              
              sum += arr[i];<br>
              
              }<br>
              <br>
              <em>// sum = 191</em>
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            Just to recap here, the for loop will go through each number in the array and add that value to the sum variable.
            Below is how this exact same problem can be solved using the higher order function “forEach”.
            <br>
            <h4 class="text-primary">FOREACH AND REDUCE</h4>
            <blockquote class="well">
              <p>
                var arr = [1,5,10,25,100,50];<br>
                var sum = 0;<br>

                arr.forEach(function (num) {<br>
                  sum += num;<br>
                });<br>
                <br>
                <em>// sum = 191</em>
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            Let’s take a look at the code snippet above and walk through how this function works. At the beginning we define
            our array and set our sum equal to zero. We call “forEach” on “arr” and we pass in an anonymous function with
            a “num” parameter. The key understanding here is that “num” represents each item in “arr”. In fact, in any
            invocation of forEach, the parameter passed in the anonymous function will represent each individual item in the
            array. Then, inside our anonymous function we perform our sum on each item.
            <br>
            <br>
            <blockquote class="well">
              <p>
                var arr = [1,5,10,25,100,50];<br>

                arr.reduce(function (num1, num2){<br>
                  return num1 + num2;<br>
                },0);<br>
                <br>
                <em>// sum = 191</em>
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            Looking at the code snippet above we can how can perform the exact same operation using the reduce method
            on arrays. You’ll notice a few differences from the forEach example above. First, we see that we do not declare
            a sum variable. Instead, we pass in the value of 0 as the second argument to reduce. This second argument is
            commonly referred to as the “accumulator”, which we can also think of as the “start” of the function. Second,
            once we call reduce, we also pass in another anonymous function with two parameters. The first of these
            parameters is the accumulator and the second represents each individual item in the array. So if we walk through
            this example we see that accumulator was set to “0” which is also “num1” the first time through the array.
            “Num2” is then the value “1” at the first position in the array. The function will add both 0 and 1 and return 1.
            So now, 1 is passed in as “num1” the second time through so now we add “5” and this iteration will now return 6.
            You can see where this pattern is heading…
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4 class="text-primary">ONE MORE (SLIGHTLY ADVANCED) EXAMPLE</h4>
            <p>
            Let’s define a function “contains” that will check and array to see if a specified value is contained within the
            array and return true if it does. First we will look at how to do this with forEach:
            <br>
            <blockquote class="well">
              <p>
                var arr = ["cat", "dog", 1,2,50, "friend"];<br>

                var contains = function (collection, target) {<br>
                  var result = false;<br>

                  collection.forEach(function (item){<br>
                    if (item === target) {<br>
                      result = true;<br>
                    }<br>
                  });<br>

                  return result;<br>
                };<br>
                <br>
                contains(arr, "dog");<br>
                <em>// returns true</em><br>
                contains(arr, "11');<br>
                <em>// returns false</em><br>
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            Contains is not a native method in JavaScript so I had to implement the function for it to work. Contains is
            actually a method found in other libraries like <a class="text-info" href="http://underscorejs.org/">Underscore</a>.
            Looking at the inner function inside of contains we see that we have invoked our forEach function once again. 
            We call forEach on the input collection (“arr” in this case) and we then loop through the entire collection to check to 
            see if the current “item” matches our target. If it does, then we set the result equal to true and we will return that. 
            Again the key to remember is that the “item” inside of forEach represents each item/value in the collection array just
            like our sum example above. Let’s take a look at how this could be solved using reduce:
            <br>
            <br>
            <blockquote class="well">
              <p>
                var arr = ["cat", "dog", 1,2,50, "friend"];<br>

                var contains = function (collection, target) {<br>
                  return collection.reduce(function (wasFound, item) {<br>
                    if (wasFound) {<br>
                      return true<br>
                    }<br>
                    return item === target<br>
                  }, false);<br>
                };<br>

                contains(arr, 50)<br>
                <em>// returns true</em><br>
                contains(arr, "hero")<br>
                <em>// returns false</em><br>
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            Let’s take a look at how this implementation for contains works. We again set our skeleton the same with the
            collection and target parameters. We then call reduce on our collection and pass in two parameters to its
            anonymous function named “wasFound” and “item”. Again, “wasFound” represents the “accumulator” or “start”
            and the “item” represents each item in the collection array. Remember, reduce also accepts a starting
            accumulator value so we can pass in “false”  as the starting value. As reduce gets invoked, the first time
            around we notice that “wasFound” is equal to “false” since that is the value we first passed in. Our if
            statement basically checks if the “wasFound” parameter has been set to true. The first time around the if
            statement doesn’t run since wasFound is false and we then check the current item against the target parameter
            and if there is a match, then “wasFound” gets set to “true.”
            </p>
            <h4 class="text-primary">IN CONCLUSION</h4>
            <p>
            Don’t be intimidated by the concept of higher order functions and callbacks. Once you get the hang of it
            and start practicing them they become second nature to you. You will see these types of functions everywhere
            including the very popular library jQuery. Read up on them and start using them in your code today!
