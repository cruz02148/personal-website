            <em><h5>June 7, 2016</h5></em>
            <p>Hey Everyone!<br><br>
            So everyone is back from solo week feeling well rested and excited to get back to work during our
            Senior phase. We had our big bad Summary Assessment on  the last day before our solo week and I honestly
            felt pretty good about it. When I first got the prompts I read through them all and I freaked out thinking
            I was so screwed and had no idea what to do. After a few minutes of thinking, I just sat down and started
            working on it and was well on my way to working through it all. I felt good about it and I was glad it was
            finally over and I was ready for solo week.
            <br>
            <br>
            During our solo week I was in a group with 2 other students and we were working on our Greenfield project.
            Our group was excited to work on this and really dive into some technologies we have wanted to work on. We 
            chose React as our library of choice and with React we then learned we should probably learn Webpack for 
            development too as those two are commonly used together in production. So we set off on solo week and started
            working.
            <br>
            <br>
            At first we had lots of excitement and couldn’t wait to work on our stretch goals. Then we hit a roadblock
            with our app working with our backend API, Webpack, and Firebase database. We soon realized how the
            development lifestyle is like when working on a project with a team. There’s a lot of head scratching,
            Googling, and ultimately stepping through our code and rethinking our process. Looking back on the project,
            we all agreed that we made the mistake of trying to learn too many new technologies at once. Towards the end
            of the project we decided to massively scale back what were trying to do and just get a product working that we
            could present on. In that regard we ultimately succeeded.
            <br>
            <br>
            Our project used the following technologies: React/ES6, Express/Node, Babel, Webpack, Heroku, Firebase,
            Material-UI for React, Axios, React Router, and a few other smaller libraries. While we didn’t accomplish
            what we initially set out to, I still feel really good about getting something deployed and something to work.
            The struggles myself and my team went through was valuable for my growth. This is something I will have to do on
            the job a lot and I can’t wait to get started on Legacy and Thesis projects coming up soon!</p>
