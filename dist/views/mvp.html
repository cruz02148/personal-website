            <em><h5>May 25, 2016</h5></em>
            <p>Hey Everyone!
            <br>
            <br>
            This is my 6th week at Hack Reactor and I can’t believe how fast time has gone by and how much I’ve learned.
            We have our Summary Assessment coming up along with our first big project (Greenfield).
            <br>
            <br>
            For the last two days I was working on my MVP project. I went into this project thinking I wanted to keep
            things simple because I didn’t want to stress out too much over getting something working and not having
            anything present to the class. So my app was simple: Build a single page application using Angular and the
            Instagram API to fetch pictures based on tag names. The toughest part of the project was getting the Instagram
            API to work properly since they recently updated the authorization permissions to fetch data from their API so
            there weren’t as many helpful resources online. However, after lots of digging I finally found something that
            worked and voila, I had a working app!
            <br>
            <br>
            After working on this for less than 24 hours, I got a working product and was looking into making it a little
            better and features. However, after reviewing my options I decided to stick to my original plan and leave my MVP
            alone and focus on reviewing other material in preparation for the next 6 weeks. I really want to dive into the
            MEAN stack and try and get another app working before my Summary Assessment that uses the whole stack, unlike my MVP.
            <br>
            <br>
            Besides the upcoming Summary Assessment, I am really looking forward to the next 6 weeks at Hack Reactor and
            learning by doing projects from scratch. It’ll be interesting to see what I along with my other classmates can
            build using the knowledge we have gained over the last 5 weeks! I am also looking forward to SOLO week and
            finally getting back to playing some basketball!</p>
